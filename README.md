# pythonRaytracer

Experimenting with ray tracing in python3.

I followed along with the three mini books about ray tracing by Peter Shirley.
You can get the ebooks for free on [In One Weekend](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/).

Instead of C++ I used Python3. Of course it's incredible slow but it's just for learning purposes.

If you are a TD or Lighting Artist with familiar with Python but not C++, 
this might give you an easier start than the C++ version in the book.

The code includes multiprocessing currently hardcoded to my 16 threads machine.

To start the renderer you have to run main_next01.py
